<p>Everybody in this universe needed something for rising up!
    they want a support for any new thing they want to try (offcourse kinda energy or kinda inner energy) <u>Rose in golorious life !Believe in the Resurrection</u>
   . we want happiness thats gives us desire . we need Believe ;If we have believe we can do anything that we want in our life
    Actually <b> "Believe means Hope</b> Believe in your heart that you are meant to live a life full of Passion , Purpose, Magic, and Miracles." The bravest heart is the one that stays close to UNIVERSE (GOD) , even when its in pain. Donot lose hope, nor be sad 
</p>  
<hr>
<p> For me believe means spritually connected with UNIVERSE aka GOD 
    who is in  with us not physically but apperancelly. Who helps us in our every moment <i>where there is no one then there is GOD.'</i>. Believe creates a hope in our heart which indirectly make a ILLUMINATION (light).<b> there should  someone who gets us like no one else Right we need it most</b> Believe means FAITH <i>"Faith is taking the first step even when you dont see the whole staircase."</i> God loves each one of us as if there is only one of us. Faith is a living darling confidence in GODS grace , so sure and certain that a man could stake his life on it a thousand times.sometimes time takes us on those situation where it cames a chance to lose patience . At that time we have to maintain our patience . Patience is somehow connected with Faith kinda <i>"HEART TO HEART CONNECTION"</i> there is not always happiness in our life or Hapiness is not constant Right? sometimes Sorrow takes place which we have to accept and <b>RELY</b> on it but do you know one thing again there is some faith started to develop in our heart offcourse one moment this sorrow will change into happiness. we just started to please on God from our inner.
    IT means FAITH is most powerful in this entire UNIVERSE. Everyone should have faith within them. Faith can change our time from sorrow to happiness. It has a willing power to change or "Change something that we dont like or we felt uneasy within it " Do you know onething "If there is cold pond and a man had to stay on it for an hour , and there is light sparkle far far away from that pond then when  he will start to have faith in his inner heart that <i>the light will touch him or insight his body! he will fell some heat or energy of warmth and He can stay whole night too in that pond</i> This is the power of faith
</p><P>Faith is like <P>H <sub>2</sub>O</P> in chemistry . Water is symbol for Faith and spritual cleansing mainly as rebirth while having faith. To produce or form water  we know apprehencely  <P>H<sub>2</sub>O</P> is indeed or required also we do "believe or faith water is safe basis for physical life". Happiness is not constant but Faith is constant . We can conquerd that faith is the first step towards success because Faith allows individuals to push past fear and doubt, which are common obstacles to starting any new endeavor although we can say that <P>3<sup>2</sup>=9</P> exactly likewise, having faith can provide the strength and resilience to persevere through difficulties and setbacks that are inevitable on the path to success . Faith can develop positive mindset like it can foster a positive and optimistic outlook , which can be crucial for maintaining motivation and focus . Faith is not just about believing ;its about translating that believe into action
</P>
<P>Taking a "leap of faith" means acting on ones belief, even when the outcome is uncertain.
    First and most important , You must have the faith that you can Succeed . you will never grab an opportunity if you think that you will fail. Always generate faith in your heart whatever is condition or situation . Be like small insects they try to climb over strip of fields! Dou you know ? they faill but keep try because they have faith in there heart that at moment they will Succeed. Faith can heal your inner pain ! when we are worried or agony we just want to cry out loud . Often we fell like a heavy load stamp into our heart at that time we have know one except Tears meanwhile If we generate Faith into our heart then,we uncertainly stop cry and start to plan what next so, that I can Fiddle on direction to Succeeding path. So beieve in yourself, Have faith in yourself, Nothing is significant than having Faith on onself. One day for sure the time will change and depart to that you  Vision.
